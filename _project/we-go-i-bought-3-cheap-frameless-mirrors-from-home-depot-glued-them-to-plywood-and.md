we go.  I bought 3 cheap frameless mirrors from Home Depot, glued them to plywood and then trimmed them out... Then I stained them dark walnut.  I wanted to lighten them up a bit so I used Rust-Oleum Chalked paint in linen white and went over the stained wood and then sanded them down a bunch.  Fun weekend project!  The entire tutorial is on our site... Just search dining room mirrors! ❤️ #shanty2chic #diy #diningroom
