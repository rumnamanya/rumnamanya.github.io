More than ever, parents are carrying the latest contemporary design ideas into their kids’ rooms. From soft neutral colors to natural textiles, children’s bedrooms and playrooms are greener, more modern, and more sophisticated than in years past. Not only does this make a kids’ room flow seamlessly into the rest of the home’s decor, but it also ensures that room designs stay relevant as young ones get older.  #Kids #Reading #Nook #Kids #Room #Toddler #Room #DIY #girls #ideas
