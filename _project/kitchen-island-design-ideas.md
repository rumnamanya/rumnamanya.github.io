Smart kitchen island measurements: If your kitchen is less than 8 feet wide and 12 feet long, don't even think about an island. You need 36 inches between the island's perimeter and cabinetry. For two cooks, you'll want an island at least 4 feet long and a little more than 2 feet deep. | Photo: Mark Luthringer | thisoldhouse.com
