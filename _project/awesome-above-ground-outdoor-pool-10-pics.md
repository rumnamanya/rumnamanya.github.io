Designed by Andres Remy Architects, a modern above-ground outdoor pool in Devoto, Argentina     When planning the placement of the swimming pool, the architects carefully studied the path of the sun. The pool is elevated from the ground creating a glass wall that allows views from within and outside. Even people inside the house can see the action in the pool while lounging on the sofa.    This project does a phenomenal job combining the best of both worlds: the natural and urban landscape.
