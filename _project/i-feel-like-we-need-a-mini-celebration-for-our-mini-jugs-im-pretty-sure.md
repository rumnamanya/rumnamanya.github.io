I feel like we need a mini celebration for our mini jugs  I'm pretty sure they're approaching their 10th birthday this year!  .  They've been through a lot... Tom first started making them because he was such a precise thrower and everything was always the same size he needed to loosen up make something that didn't need to be exact. So he made these the same weight of clay for each jug but they vary so much heights widths glazes. .  When we had our cafe they became particularly popular and many people bought the jug we'd served milk to them in  .  We had 80 as our wedding favours  .  They've been on tv they grace tables in some top restaurants. .   Tom threw 150 to raise money for the towns Christmas lights  and sold out well within 24 hours... .   Very much still a best seller here in the shop they seem the gift of choice to take home for loved ones  .  Many happy returns Glosters mini jug  . . . . . #shopkeeper #shoplife #shopdisplay #glosters #porthmadog #theshopkeepers #jug #shopsofinstagram #tableware #makersmovement #slowmade #handmade #modernmaker #wearethemakers #pottery #ceramics #claylife #theartofslowliving #beautifulmatters #thelifestylecollective #untoldvisuals #alittlebeautyeveryday #nestandflourish #collectandstyle #contemporarycraft #wheelthrown #thesimpleeveryday #myeverydaymagic  #vessel
