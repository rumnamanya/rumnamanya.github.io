This contemporary curved bench seat in the landscape is so smart. Can you imagine relaxing and kicking back in the afternoon sun. The form would also work well with exposed aggregate concrete. If done in this treatment it would then double as a skatepark with a deck and ramp. This form would also work well in a school environment where the teacher could take an outdoor class.
