If practical makes the cut for you this bathroom will be a hit !  Notice, no glass walls to scrub!  What I like even better is that a wheel chair could glide in without a problem. (Young people have been known to "break a leg" dancing.)  If baby blue isn't your first choice for tile or paint color, not a problem; I'd like to see white walls.
