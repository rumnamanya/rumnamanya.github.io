HofArc! This is Mary, a 1974 Airstream Overlander. Her simplistic and sleek design gives her an elegant flow to her spacious floor plan. A custom-cut queen-sized bed in the back, full bathroom in the mid-coach, and a convertible dinette/sleeper in the front that seats six for a meal, or quickly converts to a comfy bed for two. We just love her!
