I'm doing this one and have the perrrfect glass. All I need is my perrrfect stones, yellow natural of course, and my perrrfect Betta Fish. SweetT can do this! ~T    Well, mine is done. Complete with a couple more shoots  I already had and thermometer. Oh, and he is purple red in color. Picture coming...i made one and it was easy to do. It is on here, Pintress as well. Look for it!
