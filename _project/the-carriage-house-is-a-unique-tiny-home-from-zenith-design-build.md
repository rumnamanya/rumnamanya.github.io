The Carriage House is a Unique Tiny Home from Zenith Design + Build - The vast majority of tiny houses have the same basic layout. They are similar in size and shape to a large motorhome (not a coincidence, considering motorhomes were the original tiny homes). There is one large downstairs living space, and then one or two small lofts above for sleeping, usually with very low ceilings.
