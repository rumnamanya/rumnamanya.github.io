Up for a DIY project that Dad will get tons of use out of? Purchase enough pegboard to cover a large portion of your garage walls. Paint the whole thing white for a clean look. Tape off squares to designate hanging spots for bins and tools. Either surprise Dad on Father's Day with a completed and hung system, or gift him with containers and hooks and let him designate an organization structure.
