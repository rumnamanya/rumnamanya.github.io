Secret Garden -  Most rooms follow a distinct color scheme, but an eclectic collection of color can be an unexpected welcome. Try tying your colors to a theme, and keep main furniture pieces and walls a little more restrained for a look that is chic, not cluttered. This bedroom evokes the look of a garden getaway straight out of the pages of a fairy tale by using romantic shades of green.
