DIY Shell Mirror Purchased shells from Michael's and other craft stores.  Used 40% off coupons and spent approximately $60 in shells.  I already had the wood framed mirror.  I did use a TON of hot glue and spent many hours on this but I am very happy with how it turned out!  This was made for my daughter's Mermaid / Beach themed room!
