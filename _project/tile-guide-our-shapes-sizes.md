What’s your best shape for tile in your backsplash? There are so many options to choose from that will pair beautifully with your Cambria quartz countertops. The neutral hues in our Marble Collection pair well with bold motifs like medium diamonds, creating a fun 3-D effect. Browse other shapes and backsplash ideas from Mercury Mosaics include hexagon, fish-scale, and classic subway tile.  [Featured Design: Torquay] #MyCambria
