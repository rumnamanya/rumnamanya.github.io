This is exactly what I was searching for when looking for a campervan kitchen setup! Great water system and plumbing diagram for RV or #vanlife I like how it fully explains how to add a 12V camping sink, faucet, hand and foot water pump. There are so some good ideas in here on water storage and hacks to refill water tanks.
