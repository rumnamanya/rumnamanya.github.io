Make a golden impression right at the front door with a pumpkin overflowing with vivid chrysanthemums, subdued thistles, and seeded eucalyptus, all embellished with branches of Chinese lantern that have been colored gold with floral spray. A few golden pumpkins are strewn amid an array of naturally colorful ones to add even more shimmer and sheen to the welcoming tableau.
