Great idea! I got large wine glasses from the dollar store for $1 each and using what I had accumulated over the years from baby and bridal showers to weddings and birthday parties, I created these gorgeous candle stands for next to nothing. Such a good idea and so cute to use anywhere as decoration on the dresser or living room coffee table, etc.
