Bohemian style typically means a flair for global impact on, like the Moroccan variations in the room shown here. And even though there's a great deal of excitement in this exotically beautiful bedroom, notice that the palette is restricted to purple, dreary, and chartreuse. While a rainbow of color is fairly common with this style, it's not required; keep in mind, this is a designing theme with little view for "rules. " #bohoroomdecordiy
