Rent this Magical and Tiny Storybook Cottage for Your Next Nashville Vacation - Just outside Nashville is a tiny cottage that looks like it leaped off the page of a storybook and the best thing about it is that itâ€™s available to rent through VRBO! The 800-square foot cottage has two bedrooms and one bathroom and is exquisitely decorated with charming style. Rates start around $150 and give you full reign of the cottage and eight scenic acres 30 minutes south of Nashville.
