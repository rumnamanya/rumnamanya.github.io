The property is a large double fronted Victorian house, based in Streatham Common, South West London. It has recently been restored and renovated to a beautiful standard, keeping in mind the period in which it was built.  It showcases many original period features such as the large detailed ceiling roses and open fireplaces in both reception rooms. It also offers a unique ravaged, industrial feel in some parts of the house.
