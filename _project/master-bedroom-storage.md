Build Your Own Storage- Off-the-shelf storage units turn into a one-of-a-kind storage unit in this comfortable, pretty master bedroom. The homeowners took advantage of height -- grouping two tall units together -- as well as closed and open units thanks to doors and boxes. A platform bed offers storage, too, for extra blankets and more.
