Warm gray porcelain tiles create a modern masculine feel in this recent Woodley Park-DC bathroom remodel.  A non-working whirlpool tub was replaced with a generous walk-in shower and frameless glass enclosure. Two seven-foot-high skylights flood the bathroom with natural light and keep the space feeling open and airy.
