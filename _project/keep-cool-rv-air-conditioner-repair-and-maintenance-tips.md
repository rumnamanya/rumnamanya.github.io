Your RV is your home away from home and you want to do everything possible to ensure you are just as comfortable while traveling as you would be at home. If traveling in the summer, you will want to make sure that the RV air conditioner is providing proper air flow and keeps you cool when temperatures rise. This can be done through routine maintenance checks which should be conducted on your RV air conditioner at least once every two weeks.
