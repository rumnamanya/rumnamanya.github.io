Lemon Thyme Herbs: How To Grow Lemon Thyme Plants - Growing lemon thyme plants (Thymus x citriodus) are a lovely addition to an herb garden, rock garden or border or as container plants. A popular herb grown not only for its culinary uses but for its attractive foliage, lemon thyme plants can be planted to form a ground cover or among pavers along a path or patio. The tiny flowers are a bee attractor, aiding in the pollination of surrounding plants.
