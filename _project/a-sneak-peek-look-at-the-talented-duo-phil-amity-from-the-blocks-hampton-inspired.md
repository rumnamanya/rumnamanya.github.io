A sneak peek look at the talented duo Phil & Amity from the Block's Hampton inspired bedroom. We are loving the restful blue and white combination with beautiful black contrast and lots of layers for that luxurious feel. @amitydry chose our Antwerp Cloud quilt cover which works beautifully with her theme. What a gorgeous room to sleep in every night don't you agree?
