1960s style camping at the lake 1963 calendar - Opel Rekord Caravan  On the borders of the Bodensee, Lake Boden, in southern Germany. The border between Germany and Switzerland goes right through this lake. The Swiss call this Lake Constanz.  I have a feeling that the focalpoint in this photo is not the Opel, but the hairdo of the lady. Even the kid is looking at it.
