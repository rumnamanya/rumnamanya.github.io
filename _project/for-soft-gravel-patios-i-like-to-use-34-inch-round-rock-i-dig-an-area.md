"For soft gravel patios I like to use 3/4 inch round rock. I dig an area out flat so that I can spread it at least 3" thick and have the top be at the desired grade.  I rake it smooth and hose it down to clean it. Instant patio!  Pea gravel, which is smaller and more common, is an option too, but I find it sticks to the feet and in the soles of some shoes and gets tracked around. The 3/4 round rock tends to stay in place and is prettier. I never put landscape fabric underneath. Jeffrey Bale
