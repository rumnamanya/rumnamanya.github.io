As if Gilt Bar weren’t gorgeous enough, there’s an even more intimate speakeasy called the Library hidden below it. Red velvet tufted banquettes, antique leather-bound tomes, and exposed brick create a romantic ambience in this dimly lit subterranean bar. In addition to specialty cocktails, the Library serves the same menu as Gilt Bar upstairs. 230 West Kinzie Street; giltbarchicago.com
