Having a small backyard shouldn't stop you from growing any kind of produce that you want!  There are plenty of solutions for backyard gardening and a trellis and raised garden box combination is a great example.  Cucumber, snap peas, green beans, tomatoesâ€¦ ah, just think about that fresh organic food you can grow in a small area!  Another huge advantage of this system is that it makes harvesting a breeze.
