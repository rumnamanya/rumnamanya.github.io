In this small and modern apartment, the bedroom has a deep teal and wood accent wall providing the perfect backdrop for the artwork and bed, while black framed glass walls separate the bedroom from the living and dining area and allow the light from the windows to travel throughout the small apartment. At night, blinds and curtains can be drawn to provide privacy.
