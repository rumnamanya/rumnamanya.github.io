Surf's up, so bring the waves into your bedroom. A graphical Surf board is washed up against a richly colored abstract ground. Classic blues and greens are colors of the ocean and dominate this ensemble. The comforter reverses to a solid blue fabric. The printed sheets are a poly-cotton blend (200 thread count). Decorative pillows are embellished with zippers and embroidery. Grab your Surf board and hit the waves!
