224sf “Little Bitty House” Built and Sold by Family for $48,000 - A family in North Carolina designed and built a custom tiny house that was suitable for life with small children. Now that they’re moving out of the country, they had to sell what they lovingly called the Little Bitty House. The home has 224 square feet and has two large lofts and everything needed to raise a family simply.
