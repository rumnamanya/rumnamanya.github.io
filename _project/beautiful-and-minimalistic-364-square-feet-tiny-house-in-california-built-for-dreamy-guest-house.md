Beautiful and Minimalistic 364 Square Feet Tiny House in California Built for Dreamy Guest House - Rebecca Froelich of San Rafael, California has always dreamed of building the perfect guest house in the back of her property. After discovering the Modern Shed company, they designed their ideal 364 square foot tiny house and then filled it with beauty.
