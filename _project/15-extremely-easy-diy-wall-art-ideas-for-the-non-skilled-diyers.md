This DIY project is called Easy Silhouette Wall Art for good reason! It is the coolest and easiest wall art you will ever make! In this easy tutorial from Loweâ€™s, plywood was used as the canvass. There are various gauges of plywood. I suggest using the thinner versions, simply for ease of handling and hanging. If working with a painters canvas is more your style, a white canvas may be more to your liking.
