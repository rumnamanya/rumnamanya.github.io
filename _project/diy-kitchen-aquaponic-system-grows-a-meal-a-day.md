DIY Kitchen Aquaponic System Grows a Meal a Day The tank in this aquaponic setup holds about 400 liters (105 gallons) and will support fish like tilapia, salmon, or carp.  It holds three grow beds above the tank where vegetables can be planted.  At the top of the grow beds is a LED light hood.  This design was created to optimize space and costs with indoor food production.
