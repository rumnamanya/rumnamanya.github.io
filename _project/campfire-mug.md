Start each day of your outdoor adventure with a piping hot cup of coffee or tea in one of our Farmers' Almanac Campfire Mugs. Each mug is 14 ounces, made out of lightweight but sturdy steel, and can be used to sip your favorite drink, or eat baked beans by the fire. Nostalgic, useful, and a perfect addition to your mess kit. Choose any one of the fun retro designs that celebrates your favorite outdoor hobby #hiking, #fishing, #camping, or watching the #sunrise! Makes a great gift.
