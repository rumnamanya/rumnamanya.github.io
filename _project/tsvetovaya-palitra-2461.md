Colorful, colorful palette. Such a riot of colors is the joy of children. In addition, the mixing of warm and cool colors looks very impressive and varied. Purple, blue harmony with orange, yellow and the color of young grass. The combination is good for a child's room decoration. And also to create a bright accent in the interior areas.
