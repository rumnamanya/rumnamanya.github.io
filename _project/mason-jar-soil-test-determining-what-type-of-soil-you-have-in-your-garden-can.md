Mason Jar Soil Test  |  Determining what type of soil you have in your garden can be done with a glass jar with a lid, some water, and a sample of your soil. When soil particles separate you can see a mixture of the main soil types: sand, silt and clay. A well balanced soil (also called Loam) will have an almost even balance between the three particles. If your soil has more clay or more sand you can help your plants by learning the best watering and treatment methods for your particular soil!
