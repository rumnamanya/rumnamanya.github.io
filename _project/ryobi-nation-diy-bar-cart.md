This DIY Bar Cart is made from oak boards and iron plumbers pipe and has a nice rustic modern style. This is a very simple and forgiving project to make that only requires right angle cuts and some semi precise hole drilling. This design concept of threading boards on pipes could be adapted to makes carts in a verity of different sizes. Check out the free instructions on RYOBI Nation.
