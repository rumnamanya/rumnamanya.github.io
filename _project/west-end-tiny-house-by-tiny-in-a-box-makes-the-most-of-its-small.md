West End Tiny House by Tiny in a Box Makes the Most of its Small Space - The model includes a full service bathroom, and one that’s bigger than some I’ve seen in regular houses, as well as an open kitchen and living room area, a large bedroom, and a lot of windows to let that natural light in and create the illusion of a much larger space. Here’s a great shot of the exterior. Note how big it looks from the outside. You’ll really be surprised when you go inside!
