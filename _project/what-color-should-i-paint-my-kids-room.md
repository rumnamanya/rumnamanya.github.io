Kid's Room Paint Color Advice : Instill sweet lightness into a space with a pale yellow, such as Perfect Solution by PPG Pittsburgh Paints and a white, like Delicate White for trim. Add muted pastel paint colors like Kangaroo Paw  and Merry Music. These pastels will still be a good fit for a child's space for years down the road as they grow.
