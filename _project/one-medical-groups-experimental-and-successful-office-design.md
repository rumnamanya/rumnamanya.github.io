One Medical Group's Experimental (and Successful) Office Design - "Prior to the redesign, the space was filled with cubicles but we removed them and implemented an entirely new floor plan. This office was redesigned to hold all of One Medical Group's New York employees in the same building." The dividers on wheels help divide the space when needed. - @Homepolish New York City
