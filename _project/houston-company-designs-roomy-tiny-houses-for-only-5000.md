Houston Company Designs Roomy Tiny Houses for Only $5,000! Arched Cabins out of the Houston area set out to design and manufacture tiny houses that they could sell for only $5k and they absolutely blew it out of the water! They can be made in widths ranging from 14’ to 24’ and any length that you choose and costs are from $200 to $320 per linear foot (based on the width). The base price only includes the ribs, beams, paneling, flooring, and insulation but it’s a good start for a low price!
