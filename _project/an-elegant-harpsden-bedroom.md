A beautiful real room which ticked all the boxes for one Hammonds customer. The classic Harpsden design suited the overall style of the customerâ€™s home. The neutral coloured walls have a hint of rose which brought out the warmth of the painted stone fitted furniture. Built in matching dressing table.
