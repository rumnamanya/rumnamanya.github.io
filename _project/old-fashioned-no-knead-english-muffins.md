Don't bother preheating your ovenâ€”my English muffins are griddled through and through. Not only does the searing heat promote "oven spring" to create those coveted nooks and crannies, it gives the muffins an amazingly crispy crust and a soft and chewy interior. They're tender but hearty enough to handle savory toppings; then again, with a slow rise and a touch of honey, they're flavorful enough to stand on their own.
