Ever since I saw Jenna Lyons' living room on the cover of Living Etc.'s Sept. 2009 issue (photo 1), I've coveted a cushy yellow sofa. And recently, I spotted a similar look in Ali Cayne's living room (photo 2), featured on Domino.com. I used to think yellow in a big piece was a big no-no, but these rooms show that when paired with neutrals a yellow sofa can make a room.
