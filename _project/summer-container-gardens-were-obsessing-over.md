Shade-Loving Combo - Summer Container Gardens We're Obsessing Over  - Southernliving. Combine caladiums, creeping Jenny, and white wishbone flower for a whimsical summertime container garden. Here, we used 'Celebration' and 'Florida Sweetheart' caladiums for a vibrant planter with a graceful spill of creeping Jenny from the elevated container.
