Fiesta is a line of dinnerware introduced in 1935 by the Homer Laughlin Pottery Company of Newell, West Virginia. It was designed by Frederick Rhead, a leading ceramist of the time.  Its Art Deco design, 11 different colors and over 50 different pieces has made it extremely sought after.  Fiesta's production ceased in 1972; however, it has been reproduced since 1986 in all new colors.
