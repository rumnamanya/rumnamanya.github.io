Make your staircase garland display unique. Use zip-ties or twine (avoids scratches) to attach garland at the base of the railings close to the stair treads instead of on the banister. Load it with Christmas ornament balls, picks and berries. Then balance it out with ornaments hung individually from the banister with Christmas ribbon. The cascading effect of this white-and-silver display is frosty elegance.
