orchard-residence-dining Me: Neat! I love the idea of a traditional Japanese low table dining/living room, but  most guests wouldn't...the table location would be locked, but you could lower it back into a floor, like on boats, if you needed floor space.  Or the floor could be movable boxes, so you push them to one side. admittedly, when I've sat at those at restaurants they haven't been comfortable, mainly because kneeling put me too far from the table. Movable floor might fix that
