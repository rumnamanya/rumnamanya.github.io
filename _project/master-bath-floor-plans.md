Medium Sized Bath Floor Plan places plumbing fixtures on two walls with the vanity and toilet on one side of the room and the tub or shower on the opposite wall.  If you prefer to have a separate tub and shower, put them side by side to reduce running additional plumbing lines to each area. If you crave additional storage, opt for a large walk-in shower or a shower-tub combo and outfit the rest of the wall with a tall linen closet.
