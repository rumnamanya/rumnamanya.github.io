Last week, I shared the beautifully renovated 1960's home in Buckhead of the Southeastern Atlanta show house Part 1,  which happens every spring.  It was such a fun house to tour, with gorgeous designs and so many talented designers taking part in the house.  Today, I'm back with Part 2, so you can see the rest of the house. This is one big and rambling house, there's so much to see!
