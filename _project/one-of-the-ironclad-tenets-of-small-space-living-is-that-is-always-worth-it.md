One of the ironclad tenets of small space living is that is always worth it to find furniture that's multi-purpose. Pieces that are versatile enough to either provide at least two functions in one object, or the ability to adapt from day to day, depending on the situation. When your small space needs are specific, it's can be worth it to DIY for a custom solution that's tweak-able and a real improvement on what's available in stores.
