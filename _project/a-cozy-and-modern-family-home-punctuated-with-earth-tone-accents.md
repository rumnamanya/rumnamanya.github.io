A fresh and modern living room in a Toronto Beaches house. The color is kept neutral (off white, with blue accents). The blue accents is throughout the home and ties the whole space together. The wood coffee table top adds warmthy while its open frame balances out the bulkiness of the sofa and loveseat. Love the dark blue stools and cozy dark blue rug.
