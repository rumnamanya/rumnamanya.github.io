Waking Waves Abstract  I shot this from the back of the M/V Uncle Oscar while riding out to Star Island in the Isles of Sholes in New Hampshire. The boat was completely surrounded by the early morning fog and all you could see was the interesting wave pattern that was being created from the wake of the boat. Fortunately by the time we reached the Island the fog had started to lift and I was able to get some great photos of the nearby lighthouse and Gosport Village.  #wavephotography #oceanwave#ocean #blueocean#abstract #abstractseascape #intentionalcameramovement	#icm #longexposure	#iglongexposures #longexpohunter #landscape #landscape_lovers	#landscape_captures #mindtheminimal	#killerminimal #minimalphotography	#minimalist #minimalism	#minimal_shots #best_minimal	#ig_minimalistic #thewonderoftravel #photo_collective #sonymirrorless #igersusa #thewonderoftravel
