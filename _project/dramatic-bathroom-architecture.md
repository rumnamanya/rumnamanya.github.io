Casement windows and a porthole window introduce seafaring-inspired architecture in a master bathroom that takes its cue from shipshape spaces. These homeowners maximized their bath's square footprint by opting for a center island that houses dual vanities (handily separated by creatively placed mirrors) and plentiful storage. The placement of the center vanity left room for fitting a dressing table along one wall and creating a small sitting area in a an opposite corner.
