Block set or single knives? There are pros to both. A set gives you more for your money and usually comes with these five knives, a honing steel (a long rod-shaped sharpener), kitchen shears and, of course, a handy way to store everything. Buying individual knives lets you customize or add to your collection. Whatever you choose, these five are the most common and versatile knives you need for practically everything in the kitchen.
